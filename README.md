## How to
To get a Git project into your build you need to follow these steps.
	
 Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

      allprojects {
        repositories {
          maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
      }

 Step 2. Add the dependency

      dependencies {
	     implementation 'com.github.iHaiderAli:Utility-Package-App:-SNAPSHOT'
      }

  
  Now you are good to go. :-)
